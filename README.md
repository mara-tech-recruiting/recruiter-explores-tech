# About Me

Hi! I'm Mara, a recruiter in Michigan helping U.S. citizen engineers find W-2 roles. I work with clients **both remotely and onsite** across the U.S., connecting talented professionals with meaningful tech opportunities.  

## Why I Joined GitHub
I joined GitHub not just to explore tech projects, but to find an alternative way to connect with individuals. Traditional job boards like LinkedIn, Indeed, and ZipRecruiter haven’t been the most effective for finding U.S. citizens or W2 employees, so I wanted to try something different.  

## What I Do
- Help U.S. citizen engineers find W-2 roles   
- Work with clients remotely and onsite across the U.S.  
- Focus on transparency, respect, and meaningful tech opportunities  
- Explore creative ways to network and share resources  

## Fun Facts About Me
- I have a Chihuahua pup named Flynn.. YES, after the character from Tron 🐶  
- Always curious about new tech and recruiting trends  
- Love connecting people with the right opportunities  

## Let's Connect!
If you’re interested in networking, learning about opportunities, or just want to say hi, feel free to open an issue. I’d love to hear from you!
