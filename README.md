# About Me

Hi! I'm Mara, a recruiter exploring new ways to connect with professionals.  

## Why I Joined GitHub
I joined GitHub not just to explore tech projects, but to find an alternative way to connect with individuals. Traditional job boards like LinkedIn, Indeed, and ZipRecruiter haven’t been the most effective for finding U.S. citizens or W2 employees, so I wanted to try something different.  

## What I Do
- Connect talented professionals with opportunities  
- Explore creative ways to network and share resources  
- Learn from the projects and expertise of others in tech and beyond  

## Fun Facts About Me
- I have a Chug (Chihuahua and pug mix) pup named Flynn, after the character from *Tron* 🐶  
- Always curious about new tech and recruiting trends  
- Love connecting people with the right opportunities  

## Let's Connect!
If you’re interested in networking, learning about opportunities, or just want to say hi, feel free to open an issue. I’d love to hear from you!
